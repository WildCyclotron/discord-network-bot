# discord-network-bot
A python network bot to connect two discord servers.

# Info
In this example I have shown how you can connect two channels of two different servers using webhooks. Recieve the messages of users from the other server into yours and vice versa. This same method can be applied to connect more than one channel or the entire server with the other server.

# Procedure
Do these things before running the bot:
1. Go to the `server settings` and create a webhook. 
2. Give the webhook any random name and set the channel.
3. Repeat the above steps in the second server.

Running the file: 
1. Edit `main.py` and replace the strings with the your channel ids and webhook urls.
2. Save your changes and run the bot.
